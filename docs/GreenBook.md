# DLMS Green Book

The DLMS/COSEM specification specifies an interface model and communication
protocols for data exchange with metering equipment.

The DLMS/COSEM specification follows a three-step approach:
  - Step 1, Modelling: This covers the interface model of metering equipment and 
    rules for data identification;
  - Step 2, Messaging: This covers the services for mapping the interface model
    to protocol data units (APDU) and the encoding of this APDUs.
  - Step 3, Transporting: This covers the transportation of the messages through
    the communication channel.

Step 1 is specified in the Blue Book, while the Green Book covers steps 2 and 3.
